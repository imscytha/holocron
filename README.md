# holocron

**holocron** is a personal monorepo where I explore, experiment, and learn new
programming concepts and technologies. This repository is structured to help me
organize my learning journey in a way that makes it easy to reference, revisit,
and expand over time.

## Concept

The idea behind this repo is simple:

> *If I want to learn something new, I try it here*.

This repo could contain projects, exercises, or experiments focused on
different areas of programming. Some might probably be small snippets to test
ideas, others maybe expanded projects to deepen understanding.
