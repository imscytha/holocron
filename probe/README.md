# probe

**probe** consists of a collection of small, focused experiments, quick tests,
code snippets, and exploratory ideas. This is my sandbox for trying things out
without the need for a full project structure.

## Purpose

The goal of this folder is to:

- Experiment with new language features, libraries, and APIs
- Validate ideas quickly before integrating them into larger projects
- Keep track of random technical explorations
- Write throwaway code that helps me understand a concept better

## Notes

- These snippets are not meant to be polished or production-ready.
- Each experiment should ideally have a short description (either in a README
  or comments) explaining what is being tested.

> Think of **probe** as a scratchpad for code — fast, messy, and curiosity-driven.
